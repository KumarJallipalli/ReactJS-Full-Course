# 03. Browser & VDOM

---

## What is DOM

- DOM is the Hierarchy of Elements present in the Browser

## Why Same HTML Code works differently in different Browsers

- Because, Each Browser is built on different Engines
- Rendering of the HTML page by these Engines is different
- Hence, Different Output is displayed on Web Page

## Architecture of Browser

## Workflow of Browser

1. HTML code will be converted into Byte Code [ Machine Code ]
2. From Machine Code, Characters are generated [ like ‚Äò<‚Äô, ‚Äòb‚Äô, ‚Äòo‚Äô etc.. ]
3. From characters, Tokens are generated [ like ‚Äò<p>‚Äô, <body>‚Äô etc.. ]
4. From Tokens, Nodes/Elements are Generated [ each tag is a Node ] 
5. From Nodes, DOM is Generated [ Nodes are Arranged into Hierarchical Order ]
6. Based on DOM, A Layout is Generated
7. Now Rendering Engine will paint this Layout with Rendered Elements
8. Finally, Painted Output is displayed on the Web Page

Layout ‚Üí Prototype of the page to be displayed 

- The browser calculates the position and size of each element on the screen.
- This step is also known as "reflow.‚Äù

Rendering ‚Üí Generating Output [ Done by Rendering Engine ]

Painting ‚Üí Displaying the Rendered Elements on a web page

1. First fills in the pixels for each element
2. Layers all the elements together to produce final Output on Screen

- Once `Render Tree` is Generated, Then only Layout is formed/Created/Generated
- Once Layout is Generated, The Painting happens which is render each element & it‚Äôs pixel & the output is generated

NOTE:

- PROCESS
    - Network will transfer the data [ through packets ]
    - DOM is the Result of HTML
        - DOM is constructed Incrementally on the GO
        - HTML ‚Äî> Bytes ‚Äî> Chars ‚Äî> Tokens ‚Äî> Nodes ‚Äî> DOM
    - CSSOM is the Result of CSS
        - CSS ‚Äî> Bytes ‚Äî> Chars ‚Äî> CSSOM
    - Once both DOM & CSSOM are successfully completed/Generated, A Render Tree will be Generated
- Checkout the Performance tab from Developer Tools
    - Each of this process is recorded in there

## What is Shadow DOM..?

- Shadow DOM is a [ hidden ] DOM under any specific element
    - It allows developers to encapsulate a part of the DOM into a separate, isolated "shadow tree" within a regular DOM tree.
    - This encapsulation ensures that the ‚Äúshadow tree‚Äù is hidden from the rest of the page and does not interfere with the main DOM.
    - This Shadow DOM has a Root called Shadow Root [ which is The Entry point to this Shadow DOM ]
    - It Follows a Root & Shadow Hierarchy of Building a Component
- It is part of DOM only, but is Hidden && won‚Äôt interfere with actual DOM

- Benefits:
    - Isolation
    - Works as a component ‚Üí Reusability, Modular
    - Encapsulation ‚Üí Maintainability
- EX:
    - Input tag with type ‚Äúfile‚Äù
    - Input tag with type ‚Äúdate‚Äù

NOTE:

- DOM is for Web Page
- Shadow DOM is for the Components in Web Page

## What is Virtual DOM

- The virtual DOM is a Virtual representation of the real DOM kept in memory
    - Interacting & Updating the real DOM is slow & performance costly
    - Hence, React uses VDOM,
        - which is light weight,
        - Interacting & Updating the VDOM is fast & increases performance
- `Diffing Algo` ‚Üí Comparing the current & previous versions of VDOM & identifying the changes
- `Reconciliation` ‚Üí Process of Identifying the changes to VDOM & updating/rendering only those changes to DOM
    - It only re-renders the parts of the UI that have changed, instead of the whole UI
    - React uses `ReactDOM` library for this reconciliation

Actual def:

- `virtual DOM` is a programming concept where a ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù representation of a UI is kept in memory and is synced with the ‚Äúreal‚Äù DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.
- This process is called¬†reconciliation.
</aside>

## Working of VDOM

1. **Step 1 ‚Äì Initial Rendering**: 
    - when the app starts,
    - the entire UI is represented as a Virtual DOM.
    - React elements are created and rendered into the virtual structure.
2. **Step 2 ‚Äì State and Props Changes**: 
    - as the states and props change in the app,
    - React re-renders the affected components in the virtual DOM.
    - These changes do not immediately impact the real DOM.
3. **Step 3 ‚Äì Comparison Using Diff Algorithm**: 
    - React then uses a¬†**diffing algorithm**¬†to compare the current version of the Virtual DOM with the previous version.
    - This process identifies the differences (or "diffs") between the two versions.
4. **Step 4 ‚Äì Reconciliation Process**: 
    - based on the differences identified, React determines the most efficient way to update the real DOM.
    - Only the parts of the real DOM that need to be updated are changed, rather than re-rendering the entire UI.
    - This selective updating is quick and performant.
5. **Step 5 ‚Äì Update to the Real DOM**: 
    - finally, React applies the necessary changes to the real DOM.
    - This might involve adding, removing, or updating elements based on the differences detected in step 3.

NOTE:

---

- In a React app, the UI elements **displayed to the user** are the **Actual DOM**.
- However, React uses a **Virtual DOM** to efficiently manage and update the Actual DOM.

## Some Important Points regarding VDOM

- The Virtual DOM Is a Browser Feature [ NO, DOM is a Browser feature ]
- The Virtual DOM Replaces the Real DOM [ NO, Only updates to DOM are managed by VDOM ]
- React is the Only Library and Framework that Uses the Virtual DOM [ NO, VueJS, SolidJS also uses it ]
- The Virtual DOM Solves All Performance Problems [ No, It significantly increases the performance ]
